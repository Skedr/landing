        <p>
          Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will
          be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles
          are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan
          you select when purchasing a Subscription.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the
          exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Skedr.io cancels it. You may cancel your
          Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting
          Skedr.io customer support team.
        </p>

        <p>
          A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the
          payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Skedr.io with accurate and complete
          billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a
          valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you
          automatically authorize Skedr.io to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your
          account to any such payment instruments.
        </p>

        <p>
          Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Skedr.io will issue an electronic
          invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with
          the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
        </p>
        <h3>Fee Changes</h3>
        <p>
          Skedr.io, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the
          Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the
          then-current Billing Cycle.
        </p>

        <p>
          Skedr.io will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription
          fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes
          effective.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect
          constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
        </p>
        <h3>Refunds</h3>
        <p>
          Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Skedr.io on a case-by-case
          basis and granted in sole discretion of Skedr.io.
        </p>
        <h3>Accounts</h3>
        <p>
          When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate,
          complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms,
          which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and
          for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our
          Service or a third-party service.
        </p>

        <p>
          You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately
          upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.
