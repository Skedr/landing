          When we think about Flickr, the first thing that comes to mind is photo-sharing. Flickr
          didn't start out as a distinct social media website or smartphone app. Instead, it's a set
          of features in a tremendously multiplayer online game (MMOG). Flickr can and should be
          used for picture sharing, photo management, and archiving. It is perfect for
          photographers, in-house creative professionals, and marketing strategies. You can easily
          organise photos, bulk edit them, geotag them, and view them from anywhere.

              When Flickr was created, the concept spread like wildfire. I'll go into more depth
              here about what's missing or not so good, and how Skedr benefits Flickr users in a
              variety of ways.
            </p>
            <h3>What is the limitation of Flickr?</h3>
            <p>
              Sorry for being direct, but the UX for sharing photographs is clumsy and doesn't
              actually help understand why a photo has been throttled and when it may be shared
              again. You share the photos from each photo you want to share.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sharing using Flickr means; going photo by photo, finding matching groups for that
              kind of photo, then sharing it without receiving any feedback from the user interface.
              This is where Skedr tool comes in.
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea is to find a service that works to upload photos to Flickr Groups for you!
              After a lot of usage hoping to make the sharing of my pictures in Flickr groups as
              fast as possible, I've come across a helpful tool; Skedr. A tool that shares your
              photos to any of your groups through the tags.

                . The tag must be a word that is meaningful to that group. The best word is always
                the most generic one that may be safely added to additional groups. Since most
                groups have very specific photo types, terms like landscape, portrait, nature,

                Any photo that is throttled from the API due to limit restrictions is queued for the

                photos every week.

              If you really get addicted to Flickr â€“ Skedr is just for you! Skedr is a third-party
              tool that makes Flickr more interesting and easier to use. Although Flickr has evolved
              a lot in a few short months, it still lacks in the ability to share photos to your
              Flickr groups using tags. Allow this tool to connect to your Flickr account, and you
              can use the tags to share your photos with any of your Flickr groups. Happy Sharing!
