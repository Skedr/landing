                Manage your tags
              </h2>
              <p class="mt-4">
                A shockingly normal mistake many individuals make is tagging and
                grouping their photographs. These little subtleties make it
                harder for pictures to come up in a search, thus limiting
                openness, even when put in many groups. You need to ensure you
                put exact, clear tags in every photograph when you initially
                post them. To effectively manage your tags, take a look at the
                following few steps. These will make it easier for you to
                understand the process of tagging and prevent your photographs
                from being rejected or dismissed.
              </p>
              <ul role="list" class="list-disc list-inside my-4 ml-4 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  Read the group rules before configuring your tag/s. It will
                  help you avoid being banned. The search bar will show you
                  relevant tags from photos you have already in your group. If
                  you just joined it will not show any suggestions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can configure more than one tag but the recommended is
                  always one as it simplyfies your tag strategy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There is a special case where you want to share more specific
                  photos. For example a group that wants birds feeding or
                  eating. Add [bird] and [eating] and then turn on the tag mode.
