        Skedr is designed to be your assistant and make it easy for you to share
        your photos and digital art with tags. Simply upload tagged images and
        you’ll see by using Skedr you can share them to the tagged groups
        automatically. You’ll notice that your images are rescheduled when a
        group posting limit is reached. Magic.

                We report on the most important data from each Flickr group to
                check whether the group is active or not. Here’s some of the
                cool stuff we can do:
              </p>
              <ul role="list" class="list-disc list-inside my-4 ml-4 space-y-2">
                <li>

                  <Photo class="h-6 w-6 inline-block" />
                  and users
                  <Users class="h-6 w-6 inline-block" />
                  in the group
                </li>
                <li>
                  Group restriction limits. You will be able to see the shared
                  status of each group ( updated daily ). If you haven’t joined
                  the group, the regularity of posting and sharing will be shown
                  (forever/1 week/ no limit and so on.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  How to know if a group has been opted in or out of Flickr's
                  photo limit: Look for the <span class="text-emerald-500">
                    green circle for opted out
                  </span> and the <span class="text-red-500"
                    >red circle for opted in</span
                  >. You can hover over the circle to read the description so
                  you know where you're at.

                Manage your tags
              </h2>
              <p class="mt-4">
                The classic mistake many of you fine people make is tagging and
                grouping your images randomly or intuitively. Believe or not,
                tagging is a minor art form, there are a bunch of tagging
                techniques which can transform the discoverability of your work
                on Flickr. We have the playbook right here:
              </p>
              <ul role="list" class="list-disc list-inside my-4 ml-4 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  Read the group rules before configuring your tag/s. It will
                  help avoid any of your images being banned. The search bar
                  will show you relevant tags from photos you have already in
                  your group. Note, if you just joined it will not show any
                  suggestions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can configure more than one tag but our recommendation is
                  always one as it simplifies your tag strategy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are exceptions if you want to share more specific
                  photos. For example for the bird watchers out there you have
                  an epic shot of a flock of birds who are eating. Add [bird]
                  and [eating] and then turn on the tag mode.
                </li>
