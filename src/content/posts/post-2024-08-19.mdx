"Traveling and photography have always been intertwined. They're inseparable because in the end, the journey itself becomes the destination, and the photographs are proof that you were there, that you really saw it all."

We asked the Skedr community to share some of their epic travel shots to mark World Photography Day. But before we reveal our mini exhibition, we thought we’d share a bit more about this auspicious day. 

World Photography Day officially began in 2010; it was organized with the simple philosophy that photographers need more recognition, so let's encourage them to share their work globally. This aligns brilliantly with our Skedr mission to help photographers and digital artists reach as many Flickr fans as possible. 

The day also celebrates the invention and public release of the Daguerreotype, a significant milestone in the history of photography. In 1837, French painter and physicist Louis Daguerre invented the Daguerreotype process (zut alors!), the first publicly available photographic process that produced permanent images.

Let’s take a beat to recognize photography's role in documenting history, shaping culture, and allowing for artistic expression. The importance of photography as a medium for communication, storytelling, and preserving moments in time. And this day helps promote a sense of community among photographers and enthusiasts wherever they may be in the world. We see you.

"Which of my photographs is my favorite? The one I'm going to take tomorrow."

We love that sentiment, Imogen; our portfolios are works in progress that we edit, curate, and even limited edition print. The prospect of a new subject, a new lens, a new trip keeps us motivated to keep honing our craft.

Naturally, at Skedr, we spend a LOT of time on Flickr. The key trends we’ve seen this year that have inspired our photography fall into these seven categories:

1. Authenticity and Realness - focusing on capturing genuine emotions, spontaneous moments, and the natural beauty of everyday life. Keeping it real and human. 

2. Bold Colors and Dramatic Lighting: a resurgence of vibrant colors, high-contrast images, and dramatic lighting techniques. This creates eye-catching and thumb stopping photographs that stand out in a fast scrolling digital landscape.

3. Monochrome endures: on the flipside, the use of black and white photography has never really  gone away, offering a timeless and classic aesthetic.

4. Environmental Awareness and Sustainability: photographers are increasingly incorporating themes of environmentalism and sustainability into their work.
Documenting the beauty of nature, highlighting the issues, and promoting sustainable practices as natural habitats are under threat from climate change. Reflecting the growing global awareness and concern for our planet.

5. Minimalism and Simplicity: minimalist compositions, clean lines, and uncluttered backgrounds and negative space are gaining popularity. These photographs pull focus on the subject and create a sense of calm, working brilliantly for architecture, and portraiture.

6. Inclusivity and Diversity: There's a growing demand for greater representation and diversity in photography. Photographers are showcasing a wider range of people, cultures, and perspectives. Which then promotes inclusivity and challenges traditional aesthetics.  

7. Beyond retro - There's a renewed interest in vintage and film photography, despite the dominance of digital photography. The unique aesthetic and tactile experience of film photography appeals to many photographers. Inspite of the higher costs of the film, working with film is here to stay.
