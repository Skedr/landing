French photographer Jerome Brouillet's image of Brazilian surfer Gabriel Medina floating above the Tahitian ocean mid-air, giving the number one sign became the defining image of triumph of the 2024 Olympic Games. And it gave us inspiration to dive into water photography this September. 

As Jerome puts it; “if all conditions are met—weather, waves, light, if the boat driver is in the right position, and if you know how to use your camera—you can take good images of surfing in Teahupo'o.” He adds: “All the rest is experience, timing, and a bit of luck! This differentiates a good shot from a great shot.”

Noted Jerome, we are definitely aiming for great not good. We asked fellow photographers on Flickr to share their work from waterfalls to lake reflections and still life compositions. Water makes the subject so interesting. Check out the gallery below.

We like to be helpful so have also compiled Skedr's top tips for taking your own shots.  

## Location, location, location
Nothing adds pure joy to a good hike more than discovering different sources of water in the wild from waterfalls to streams, rivers, and lakes. Your access to these beauty spots will be governed by nature, fences and the weather. So take time to find your perfect location that's off the beaten path. 

The waves crashing on the beach or harbour is another photography challenge, dependent on the tides, so do your research. We recommend you scout locations at various times of the day to find your favorite shape of water and light.

## Timing and weather are everything
The quality of light and weather conditions will of course govern the range of photos you'll be able to capture that day. Consider how you can make the most of rain or fog to create a unique atmosphere. Early morning dew has a diamond like quality on cobwebs, petals and leaves but requires macro skills whereas shooting a misty reflection calls for you to focus manually and use a tripod. Foggy conditions can reduce contrasts within the scene and visibility plus it is made of tiny fragments of moving water. Bring a lens cloth to mop up any condensation. 

Classically, shooting during golden hour, just after sunrise and before sunset, will bring you that famous golden glow. Look for reflections in the water, which can add depth and interest to your images. Position yourself to capture both the water and its reflection, using the warm light to enhance the feel of the scene. Consider using a polarising filter to reduce glare on the water's surface and enhance the colours. You can often use faster shutter speeds due to the available light.

Blue hour arrives shortly before sunrise and after sunset, when the sun's position just below the horizon produces those cooler bluer tones. Since blue hour is darker, increase your ISO to ensure proper exposure. Take advantage of the low light to create long exposures that smooth out the water. Use your tripod to keep the camera steady, and consider using a remote shutter release to avoid any vibrations.

## Techniques for capturing water in motion 
We're all aiming for that dreamy effect in waterfalls or a stormy, purple coastline so take note of these hints and techniques. Neutral density filters are an essential accessory when photographing moving water. A shutter speed of 1/500sec usually works to freeze that wave, although slightly slower speeds can also be effective. If it's really windy use your tripod to stabilise your camera. For a more abstract treatment try panning your camera. 

If it's safe to do so and you've packed your waders, get into the water to capture the best possible composition. It's also quite a refreshing experience that you'll probably never forget. 

If you're looking to create leading lines in fast-flowing rivers or as the water draws back down a sandy beach, you'll need a long exposure. Set shutter speeds between 1/8sec and 4sec depending how fast the water is moving. If you're at the seashore, wait for the waves to begin to recede down the beach for the best effect.

## Essential Gear: what you need to get started
We're not going to dive into the specifics of camera kit, there are loads of other places you can find that. But we are going to share what might be overlooked: 
1. A tripod 
2. Super fine lens cloth to remove dust and water spray
3. Cable or remote release.Essential for allowing you to release the shutter at just the right moment to catch a particular water effect without shaking the camera.
4. Waders if you want to fully immerse yourself
5. Sea shoes if it warm enough to paddle to protect your feet from rocks and pebbles 
6. Waterproof bag big enough for your camera and lenses
